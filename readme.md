## How to use

Install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and add `hyper-acrylic` to plugins in `.hyper.js` configuration file.

Choose the color by settings the `backgroundColor` to a color with alpha value between 0 and 1, both excluded.

## Contributions

Any contributions is welcomed, I will glady incorporate any pull request.
Some possible improvment we could work on are:
 * Improving the acrylic effect (with the undocumented API setWindowCompositionAttribute())
 * Make the C++ code compile with node-gyp rather than compiling it and uploading it
 * Add a setting/shortcut to toggle it on and off rather than disabling the extension
